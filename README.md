# Human Action Recognition using 3D CNN

* Video classification problem on spatiotemporal dimensions
* Used concept of Separable Kernels to split 3D CNN into (2+1)D 
CNN to reduce number of parameters.
* Custom ResNet model with each 2D conv layer replaced by a 
(2+1)D conv layer
* Achieved test accuracy >70%
